<h1>The Best Movies According Pedro Vilas Boas</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Remember the Titans</h3>
<p>At the same time that the film addresses the racial problem of black people's 
integration into society, it tells a dramatic and engaging story of the resilience 
of a football team.</p>

<h3>Replacements</h3>
<p>An unnamed (fictional) professional football league is hit with a players' strike with 
    four games left in the season. Washington Sentinels[3][4] owner Edward O'Neil calls a 
    former coach of his, Jimmy McGinty, telling him that the league's going to finish the 
    regular season with replacement players, and asks McGinty to return to coach the Sentinels 
    the rest of the season, adding that winning three of the last four games will get the Sentinels 
    into the playoffs. McGinty accepts on the condition that he can sign the players he wants 
    without O'Neil's interference.</p>
